I decided to add a DOI through Zenodo, this also means todays is the first official release as a requirement for publication.

After a long while I am picking up this project, during last year I've only added minor fixes. However,  this semester I will be teaching an undergraduate systematics course, so I'll probably be able to progress on generating figures and lectures using this dataset.
Another priority is to make the dataset citable. Through the recent publication of [Escudero & Wendel, 2020](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.16802), I realize this project could have a wider impact and citations would be desirable.

I began subsetting the plant phylomoji dataset. It could be easier to work with a reduced number of terminals on some scenarios.
! I want to improve visualization and make a first tutorial on subsetting, clade annotation and labeling

Here are some examples of the datasets


"Relaxed version" includes plant byproducts and species with dubious identifications.
